## Getting Started

In this project, you will refactor a class controller that was written in 2015 to provide vending of electricity meters and connecting to other third party APIs providing super vendors services. It contains more
than 500+ lines of code which mean there are a lot of things going on there.
We are leveraging this to know how best you can work with us at @Tonote on the backend.
